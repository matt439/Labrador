# Review index

This is the current map of reviews and their live ledgers. The review text is
historical: its findings, counts, source paths and line numbers describe the
revision it reviewed. Do not rewrite that text as fixes land. Update the
owning status file, or the tracking section below where no separate status
file exists, in the same commit as a resolution. Record evidence or a reasoned
rejection; an unchecked candidate is a question to verify, not a confirmed bug.

[TODO.md](../../TODO.md) indexes open work, and
[BACKLOG.md](../product/BACKLOG.md) orders the stories. This file identifies
the evidence and owner; it does not put a frozen review ahead of that order.

## Every entry in this folder

| Entry | Historical source | Current status owner and what remains |
|---|---|---|
| [README.md](README.md) | The original ArtAttack review, before the repository split | [IMPLEMENTED.md](IMPLEMENTED.md) records all 36 critical fixes; [round-2/PLAN.md](round-2/PLAN.md), section 6, closes the extraction plan and its tail. Frozen; no independent engine queue remains from this review. Old game paths refer to ColourWars. |
| [all-findings.md](all-findings.md) | Detailed findings from the original ArtAttack review | Frozen companion to README.md; use the same remediation records, not its original severity counts as a current backlog. |
| [findings.json](findings.json) | Raw original ArtAttack findings | Frozen companion data; same status owners as README.md. |
| [IMPLEMENTED.md](IMPLEMENTED.md) | Original-review remediation record, dated 2026-08-09 | Frozen final record. Its old game-side residuals are outside this standalone engine; the round-2 plan records the completed engine extraction. |
| [round-2/](round-2/README.md) | Second review and appendices, before the split | [PLAN.md](round-2/PLAN.md), section 6: the plan and its tail are spent, nothing open. Frozen. |
| [rtcd/](rtcd/README.md) | *Real-Time Collision Detection* candidate sweep | Frozen candidate list, not an implementation plan. Decisions belong to [round-2/PLAN.md](round-2/PLAN.md), whose engine work is complete. Reopen a technique only against a current need. |
| [backend-equivalence/](backend-equivalence/README.md) | Three-backend audit at `57b65b3`; INVENTORY, TEST-GAP, DRIFT and GAPS are frozen too | Superseded by the five-backend sweep. Use [backend-equivalence-2/STATUS.md](backend-equivalence-2/STATUS.md) and its [LEDGER.md](backend-equivalence-2/LEDGER.md) adjudication; the original DRIFT.md is not live. |
| [backend-equivalence-2/](backend-equivalence-2/README.md) | Five-backend sweep at `ca5b2e3` | [STATUS.md](backend-equivalence-2/STATUS.md) is live: G6a's Application/viewport integration test and the named low-tier p99 remain. See [remaining verification](#remaining-verification-and-hardware). |
| [d3d12/](d3d12/README.md) | Fourth-backend review | No separate STATUS.md. [D3D12 tracking below](#d3d12-tracking) owns the seven unverified behavior questions from section 6; the confirmed findings and two count-only candidates were answered by the follow-up series. |
| [vulkan/](vulkan/README.md) | Fifth-backend review at `4d91b91` | No separate STATUS.md. [Vulkan tracking below](#vulkan-tracking) owns section 7's candidate group and the two open section-6 questions, including the platform re-entry condition. |
| [gpt6/](gpt6/README.md) | Review at `9dea4516` on 2026-09-17 | The eleven numbered findings are closed in [the resolution map below](#gpt-6-resolution-map). Opportunities remain in TODO.md as REV#7 to REV#10 and the low-tier record; they are separate from those findings. |
| [2026-09-26/](2026-09-26/README.md) | September 26 review, supplement and reproduction evidence | [STATUS.md](2026-09-26/STATUS.md) is live and [FIXES.md](2026-09-26/FIXES.md) records all 23 numbered resolutions. The four hardening candidates, manual limits and tooling CI follow-up remain separately tracked; see below. |
| [colourwars-reports/](colourwars-reports/README.md) | Engine decisions on private client reports, assessed at `0c15f34` | Its README's decision table is live. Report 19 still needs evidence of a visible launch before the first present. PI-09's public filing/disclosure decision belongs to the owner. Keep private client detail out of this tree. |
| INDEX.md | This map | Live. Maintain this roster when adding or retiring a review, and the tracking below when resolving an item it owns. |

## D3D12 tracking

The confirmed findings were addressed by the nine-commit series from
`6ae4a15` through `06f0b5f`. Commit `e92a982` explicitly resolves section 6's
items 7 and 8, the shared-header/backend counts and design-document counts.
That closure does not verify the seven behavior questions. Their original
numbers are retained here so a later resolution can name the exact candidate.

Source: [D3D12 review, section 6](d3d12/README.md#6-not-verified).
Work index: **REV#3** in TODO.md.

- [ ] **6.1** Check the duplicated view-opening loops in `open_frame()` and
  `set_view_count()` and whether a shared operation improves their agreement.
- [ ] **6.2** Check per-flush descriptor-heap-start calls and the analogous
  back-buffer-view calls before changing their caching.
- [ ] **6.3** Check the per-submit command-list vector allocation and whether
  retained capacity is appropriate on the actual submission path.
- [ ] **6.4** Check the two buffer-construction helpers before sharing them
  inside the backend folder.
- [ ] **6.5** Check the D3D11 factory-refresh branch against current resize
  callers, including monitor moves and no-size-change arrivals.
- [ ] **6.6** Check `sprite.hlsl`'s profile and arithmetic-equivalence claims
  against the current shader profiles and the measured golden allowance.
- [ ] **6.9** Check full texture-load/read-back footprints for multi-mip DDS
  content, beyond the lines the original review verified.

## Vulkan tracking

Source: [Vulkan review](vulkan/README.md), sections 6 and 7, and its
[all-findings.md](vulkan/all-findings.md) final candidate list. The verified
must-fix, should-fix and minor findings have their follow-up commits; the
later G9 closure is `6168700`. Those repairs do not turn unverified candidates
into verified findings.

- [ ] **6.1 / REV#4: minimize severity.** Run a sample under the Vulkan
  validation layers and record whether acquire or present returns
  `OUT_OF_DATE` while minimized, and the resulting behavior. This needs the
  actual interactive sequence; a source reading does not supply the result.
- [ ] **6.2 / REV#5: surface-platform questions, deferred.** Reopen with the
  Android port: check the format fallback's copy-versus-blit argument,
  `compositeAlpha` against supported modes, and whether `preTransform` must
  be applied. No supported desktop configuration establishes those answers.
- [x] **6.3: index-upload dependency.** `ecba539` adds the
  `TRANSFER_WRITE` to `INDEX_READ` barrier. This candidate also appears in
  section 7's frozen list and must not be counted as a fresh missing barrier.
- [x] **6.4: disclose thin frames-in-flight coverage.** `b4bcda0` adds the
  missing disclosure. This closes the documentation question, while the
  actual lifecycle coverage remains **REV#7**, below.
- [ ] **Section 7 / REV#6: adjudicate the candidate group.** The source lists
  65 candidates that its verification budget did not reach. That is the
  historical list size, not a count of current defects: the index barrier
  above is resolved, and shared comment claims may overlap later sweeps.
  Recheck each against the current tree before accepting it. Record the
  candidate's original text and a confirmed/refuted/already-resolved verdict,
  with evidence, rather than editing the frozen list or copying its severity.

## GPT-6 resolution map

The numbered findings in [gpt6/README.md](gpt6/README.md) describe the reviewed
revision. These commits answer all eleven; they are an implementation record,
not a new run of the review. The September 26 review's
[historical findings and evidence limits](2026-09-26/README.md#historical-findings-and-remaining-evidence-limits)
also records the earlier repairs as present.

| Findings | Resolution commit |
|---|---|
| G6-01, G6-06: native window lifetime and restore dimensions | `fb542b1` |
| G6-02: ordinary state-stack destruction | `eb7336f` |
| G6-03: constant initialization | `e03606f` |
| G6-04: draw bounds and culling agree | `8dcab46` |
| G6-05: segment/corner traversal | `d373f71` |
| G6-07: pause close input leaking into play | `8e74546` |
| G6-08: pause opened under a held direction | `1a45474` |
| G6-09: content rooted beside the executable | `92966b0` |
| G6-10: targeted builds run architecture checks | `3a70b82` |
| G6-11: actual locked-piece particle reconstruction | `984cf13` |

## Remaining verification and hardware

These entries point to their existing live owners. They do not claim that a
green headless suite supplies a human session or a hardware measurement.

| Work | Live owner and remaining evidence |
|---|---|
| **REV#1**, five-backend G6a | [backend-equivalence-2/STATUS.md](backend-equivalence-2/STATUS.md), section 3: resize a live Application and compare `fullscreen_viewport()` with `back_buffer_size()`. |
| Named low-tier p99, **SM-07** | The same STATUS.md, section 4: the Radeon/four-core measurement, after SM-01 to SM-05. EC2's L4 results do not substitute for this machine. |
| **REV#7**, GPT-6 opportunity 2 | TODO.md: consecutive presented frames without per-frame read-back, resize and teardown with work outstanding, under D3D12 diagnostics and Vulkan synchronization validation. |
| **REV#8**, GPT-6 opportunity 4 | TODO.md: XAudio2 output-device recovery, followed by a real-endpoint check. A redistributable audio sample exists; output recovery remains the question. |
| **REV#9**, GPT-6 opportunity 3 | TODO.md: replay/file-version work is deferred until a client needs it (T1). |
| **REV#10**, GPT-6 opportunity 5 | TODO.md: the overlay remains deferred until a client needs it. `Application::frame_timings()` supplies phase measurements, not the proposed distribution overlay or low-tier p99. |
| **REV#11**, September 26 hardening | [September 26 README](2026-09-26/README.md#lower-priority-hardening-and-unverified-candidates): [hardening verification below](#hardening-verification) records the transactional insertion fix and the remaining modifier, cleanup and glyph-bound checks. |
| **REV#12**, September 26 manual limits | [STATUS.md](2026-09-26/STATUS.md) and [FIXES.md](2026-09-26/FIXES.md): real device removal, interactive minimize/restore/drag, physical layouts/device changes and real sleep/wake need a person and devices. |
| **SM-19**, September 26 priority 3 | [STATUS.md](2026-09-26/STATUS.md): the offline Windows CI gate is implemented; the deliberately failing throwaway-branch CI observation remains open. Local PowerShell execution-policy limits are recorded there. |

When a status owner closes an item, update its TODO row and story box in the
same commit. Leave the historical finding readable, including any rejected
premise, so later work can distinguish a repair from a disproved claim.

## Hardening verification

The September 26 hardening candidates are separate from its 23 numbered
findings. This is the current disposition of **REV#11**:

- [x] **Transactional name insertion, 2026-10-26.** `NameTable::add` and
  `Registry::add` erase a newly inserted name if the storage append throws.
  Public-API throwing-move regressions verify failed-name absence, existing
  handles, an unrelated add and same-name retry without aliasing. Native
  `CoreTests` passes. Clang compiles the changed code, but replacing the
  existing `out/build/wasm-release/tests/core/CoreTests.js` is access denied;
  no Node runtime pass is claimed. The caller's vector element/storage
  exception guarantees remain those of the underlying vector.
- [ ] **Both sides of a modifier.** Verify left/right Shift, Control and Alt
  aggregation and focus-loss clearing on both window backends.
- [ ] **Exceptional cleanup.** Check scene task-submission failure and Vulkan
  buffer construction after allocation. GL texture upload/table insertion
  already uses a scoped owner; that source finding is not still an open leak.
- [x] **Glyph ink outside layout measurement, 2026-10-26.** Text caches the
  union of the layout rectangle and the cells drawing actually visits, while
  retaining the layout origin. Synthetic-font regressions cover negative y
  bearings, drawable whitespace, setter invalidation, transforms and real
  scene culling with the null renderer. `Font::measure()` stays unchanged.
  Focused tests pass on all five native backends and the changed code/tests
  compile under clang; all four native rasterizers pass the existing golden
  set. This establishes the custom-font counterexample and its fix, not a
  defect in the checked-in sample fonts.
