# LineSweeper — design decisions

A falling-block game, and the sample that shows what a whole game on this
engine looks like. This file records the decisions behind it and the reasons,
so that a reader meeting the code cold does not have to reconstruct them, and
so that a decision cannot be quietly reversed without meeting its argument.

It is deliberately not a design *philosophy*. `docs/design/` holds those, there
are three of them, and this is not a fourth: everything here is a choice about
one sample, made under those three. Where a decision below is really an engine
commitment, it says so and names the document it belongs in.

**Status: stub.** The wiring, the layering and the world value exist. The rules
do not yet — `rules/tick.h` is the next commit, and nothing is drawn from the
world until after that.

## What it is

Ten columns, twenty visible rows, two spawn rows above them. Seven four-cell
pieces on an integer gravity curve, with a visible next queue, a hold slot,
hard drop, a shadow showing where a hard drop lands, seven-bucket
randomisation, T-spins and back-to-back scoring.

Not included: perfect-clear bonus tables. Those exist to reward a technique
against opponents, and this game has none.

## The decisions

### It is a second sample, not a replacement for `samples/minimal`

`minimal` answers "how do I start a project on this engine" and is meant to be
copied — ARCHITECTURE says starting a game *is* copying it. LineSweeper answers
"what does a finished game look like" and is meant to be read. A sample large
enough to answer the second question is a bad answer to the first, and the
instruction to copy it stops being true the moment the file count goes up.

The practice this follows is near-universal in comparable libraries: raylib,
SDL3, SFML, Allegro 5, bgfx, Ogre3D and Urho3D all keep samples in the engine
repository, and Allegro splits them into `examples/` for one-feature programs
and `demos/` for complete games on exactly this line. The engines that moved
samples out — Godot, O3DE, Flax — moved them for **bytes**, not for code:
O3DE's sample projects were 6+ GB. This sample's content is a font and a JSON
file. If it ever grows an art budget into the megabytes, that is the signal to
revisit, and it is the only such signal in the field.

### The rules are a static library that links nothing

`LineSweeperRules` links `artattack_settings` — an INTERFACE target carrying
compiler flags and no libraries — so there is no way for it to reach an engine
symbol. An `#include "engine/..."` that resolves still fails at link.

That wall buys one property, and it is the one worth having: **the whole game
is playable inside the test suite**, with no window, no device and no renderer.
A rule can be asserted rather than played. It is also what makes the replay
test possible at all, since a headless test cannot construct an `Application`.

A static library rather than a folder for the same reason ARCHITECTURE gives
for MattMath being one: when a wall has to be load-bearing rather than a
convention, the escalation is cheap and this is it.

### Three layers, and the middle one may not see the rules' verbs

- `rules/` — the simulation. Includes nothing from `engine/`.
- `presentation/` — reads a `World` and draws it. May include `rules/world.h`;
  may **not** include `rules/tick.h`.
- `states/` — the only place that includes both, and where input becomes a
  rules verb.

The second rule is what makes "read the presentation without learning the
rules" true rather than aspirational, and it maps exactly onto the engine's own
`update()` writes / `draw()` reads split.

Price, stated plainly: this is a wall in *this* repository. Someone who copies
the tree and deletes the check gets folders and no discipline. It teaches by
existing; it does not travel.

### The match is one value, and four asserts say what that means

`World` is 276 bytes: five 32-bit counters, sixteen single-byte flags and
timers, the active piece, the queue, and 220 bytes of cells. It is trivially
copyable, trivially destructible, and has no padding bits.

Restarting is `world = World{}`. Snapshotting is `World snapshot = world;`.
Comparing two matches is `std::memcmp`. None of those needed a line of code
written for them, and that is the T11 demonstration this sample exists to make.

The fourth assert is the one worth reading:

```cpp
static_assert(std::has_unique_object_representations_v<World>);
```

It is the standard's own name for "no padding bits", which is what makes
`memcmp` a defined comparison rather than a hopeful read of indeterminate
bytes. It is *also* false for `float` and `double` — so the same line keeps the
simulation integer-only, and fires on the day somebody adds a float "just for
the lock timer", which would have made every replay depend on `/fp:precise` and
on this compiler. One trait, two invariants.

### Every duration is in ticks, and `main.cpp` pins the tick rate

Lock delay, the shift timer and the gravity curve are all counted in fixed
steps, never in seconds. That is what keeps a replay independent of how long a
frame took.

It also means `options.target_fps = 60` in `main.cpp` is load-bearing rather
than decorative. Nothing in the engine pins it — `ApplicationOptions::validate`
only checks it is positive — so a game that sets 120 runs at half speed with no
error anywhere. The line carries a comment saying so.

### T-spins are in, and they pay for the kick tables

T-spins were initially cut: about seventy lines, plus the only cross-verb state
in the simulation (whether the last successful action was a rotation), to feed
scoring branches a solo player does not compete over.

They are in because a falling-block game shipping without them reads as
unfinished to anyone who plays the genre, and this is meant to be a real client
rather than a rules exercise. Two consequences worth recording:

- **Lock delay stops being optional.** The whole move is rotating the piece
  into the notch *after* it has landed, so with no lock-delay window T-spins are
  unperformable. The half-second-and-resets rule can no longer be trimmed on
  simplicity grounds without silently deleting the feature.
- **The kick tables earn their keep.** The SRS wall-kick table is the largest
  block of incidental complexity in the rules and the one part a reader must
  check line by line against a published source. Without T-spins it is
  conformance for its own sake and a simpler rotation system would be defensible
  on T3 grounds. With them, the kicks *are* the mechanism that puts the piece in
  the slot.

Back-to-back came back with them, because it is what makes a T-spin worth
setting up rather than merely worth more points.

### Additive blending needs no engine change

The engine looked as though it could not blend additively: `renderer.cpp` opens
every batch with a null blend state and the word "blend" appears nowhere in
`engine/render/`. That reading was wrong, and the correction matters because the
whole visual pitch rests on it.

DirectXTK substitutes `CommonStates::AlphaBlend()` for a null blend state, and
that is `CreateBlendState(D3D11_BLEND_ONE, D3D11_BLEND_INV_SRC_ALPHA)` with
`BlendOp = ADD` — **premultiplied** alpha, not straight alpha. The equation is
`dst = src.rgb + dst.rgb * (1 - src.a)`, so a texel authored with `a = 0` and
`rgb > 0` adds with no attenuation. Glow is an atlas decision, not an API gap.
The same one state also expresses opaque drawing, a darkening vignette and a
full-screen colour grade.

A `BlendMode` on the seam is therefore **declined**, and not only as
unnecessary. `set_filter` closes and reopens the batch on every change, because
a sprite batch cannot swap state mid-`Begin`; a blend selector would inherit
exactly that, and a caller toggling it per particle would turn a handful of
draw calls into thousands. That is the frame-loop tax T8 refuses.

What is genuinely lost, rather than worked around: glowing **text**. `draw_text`
goes through `SpriteFont` into the same batch, and the tool that builds a
`.spritefont` will not write `a = 0` glyphs. The answer is a soft quad behind
the text, which reads better at this resolution anyway — but it is a workaround
and is named as one.

### Particles are not in the first version

The first version is the game: rules, plain drawing, the state flow, the tests.
No particle field, no glow, no instrument panel.

That means the shipped stub and its first few commits demonstrate the
*value-semantics* half of what this sample is for and not the *data-layout*
half. Deferred, not dropped — the particle field is where the second half lands,
and it is the thing a modern falling-block game's identity is actually made of,
which is why this genre was chosen over the alternatives.

## Still open

- **The reference machine.** The hardware-floor claim this sample is eventually
  meant to prove needs a named part, a named resolution and a measured p99. No
  such measurement exists. Until one does, no number in this repository should
  be described as a floor.
- **Whether the layer rule gets a build check.** `cmake/check_engine_includes.cmake`
  is the model. It is not worth writing while `rules/` is one header and one
  translation unit.
